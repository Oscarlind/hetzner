Just a simple role for making your hetzner server a little bit more secure.

Requires that you have your public key added to your Hetzner account. (Working to fix in the future)

Simply create a inventory file with your Hetzner and make sure the variables are correct for you.

To do:
 - Grab the public key directly from Hetzner API
 - Setting up Endlessh
